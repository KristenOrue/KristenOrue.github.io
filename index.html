<p> My name is Kristen Orue and I am back in school after a 10 year break. I am from Miami FL and love my new home in Bend, OR. I enjoy almost all things new which include everything I have learned since moving to Bend. I work at Crux Fermentation Project as a beertender and when I don't have life obligations I love reading comic books, novels, listening to music, and snowboarding. Halloween is my absolute favorite holiday the music,  horror movies, pumpkins, weather, and of course the costumes.</p>

<p> I work at <a href="https://www.cruxfermentation.com/">Crux Fermentation Project</a>. I don't think I'll ever not work there even if it's just once a week one day when I have a full time career. It has a beautiful view of the Cascades, I get to work with my friends, they experiment all the time with a variety of yeast, hops, and even other forms of Fermentation like pickling and cider. I've always been passionate about craft beer and I couldn't have picked a better place to work where I can share my passion with others.</p>

<h2 style="color:#000099">COMICS!!</h2>
<p>My parents are from Peru and Cuba, Comic books are not something they have ever found remotely interesting or useful. I love reading because my mother encouraged the arts and classics. Education was and still is the most important tool for two people who moved to an entirely different coutry at age 20 in search of a better life for themselves and their children. I was allowed to watch "Much Ado about Nothing" and "Amistad" because they're educational but "Jurassic Park" at age 13 was a no go. That being said my best friends Jonathan Zimmer his wife Theresa introduced me to a whole new world first by taking me to Star Wars Celebration. I was hooked. The creativity and imagination required for buiding a lightsaber out of $20.00 worth of spare tools at a hardware store. I felt like a kid again. Then, we went to my first comic book store where I left with a pile of books to enjoy which I thought would include lots of "pow!", "Gee Goly Batman", and Spiderman saying, "High five! Oops! I guess you're stuck with me"...althought the Spiderman one may be a direct quote. Instead, it was right up my alley: analysing the light and darkness found in humanity (you either die a hero or live to become the villain ), exploring family dynamics, mental illness, political isses, etc. you name a theme from a classic novel and I'll name a comic book that delves into the same theme. At comic con panels authors discuss what they were going through when writing that book or how "Lazarus" a book about a future world run by the 6 richest families controlling resources where a bionic woman named Forever Carlyle is a weapon created by one of the families and doesn't know it, is really about the author's exploration of nature versus nurture. I also gained an appreciation for the complexities behind the relationship between an author and the artist. An author had to hand his/her writing over to an artist and say, "express what's in my mind" and somehow it happens, sometimes with ease and sometimes with a year of banter but everytime it's a masterpiece. For me the ultimate combination was using my own creativity and ingenuity to create a costume. I love going to comic cons for many reasons but asking a 17 year old dressed like Pennywise to take a picture only to hear a high pitched sweet little voice say, "yea sure" followed by posing like a murderous terrifying clown is the main reason.  </p>
